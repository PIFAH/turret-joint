# Major comoponents to place inside enclosure in simplest implementation

* Two (2) Seeed Studio Motor Controllers (v 2.0?)
* One Arduino Uno
* A 12 volt lipo or lithium ion battery (currently unspecified). This will be a typical Radio controlled hobby battery of some kind.
* A radio board of some kind (currently unspecified. This is a lower priority.)

The enclusre hase five other requirements:

1. The Enclosure must be openable to allow the battery to be taken out and recharged.
2. It must be ventilated to allow waste heat (not too much, approximate 25 watts at most) to be ejected.
3. It must have (small) attachmentment points in approximately a tetrahedral configuration.  That is, it should have
3 attachment points at the base in an equilateral triangle, and one at the top at the center.  These can just be small holes
of any kind that we can bend the spring wires into.
4. It must fit within a 10 centimeter cube (10 centimeters on each side.)
5. It needs 4 entry points, each of which must be a slot 13 mms long and 4 mm wide.

# turret-joint
A three-dimensional joint for connecting up to 12 members to a central point allowing angular movement of members

## Motivation

This project is part of the Gluss project. (Click for introductory video.)

In order to build a Gluss, we have to have a joint that can connect multiple members coming into a point.  In the Octet truss
configuration of Buckminster Fuller, this join is a cuboctahedron connecting up to 12 members, though more generally nine, 
and with only 3 you can build a tetrahedron, the simplest 3D gluss robot.

But the joint must allow for motion.  In particular, in a Gluss model, it must support the widest and narrowest angle which 
can be constructed by the individual Gluss members in the most fully and least fully extended configurations.

This repo holds the physical designs of such a joint, which I call a "turret joint".

## Sharing and Patent Law

The Public Invention project does not seek patents on any of its invention.  The Turret Joint is a significant invention. 
If someone knows of this being done before, please inform me.

You are free to use anything you find in the repo under either the GPL or the Creative Commons Share-Alike license v4.0.

However, you are not free to apply for a patent on this.  That would be fraud and illegal. Don't do that.

Public Invention seeks to give gifts to the whole world. If someone takes one of our freely published inventions and seeks a monopoly through a patent on it, it is directly counter to our mission, in addition to being fraudulent and illegal.

However, you are welcome to manufacture and sell a Turret Joint to your heart's content. We (and the inventor in this case, Robert L. Read) would appreciate attribution of the idea.

# turret-joint
A three-dimensional joint for connecting up to 12 members to a central point allowing angular movement of members

## Motivation

This project is part of the Gluss project.

In order to build a Gluss, we have to have a joint that can connect multiple members coming into a point.  In the Octet truss
configuration of Buckminster Fuller, this join is a cuboctahedron connecting up to 12 members, though more generally nine, 
and with only 3 you can build a tetrahedron, the simplest 3D gluss robot.

But the joint must allow for motion.  In particular, in a Gluss model, it must support the widest and narrowest angle which 
can be constructed by the individual Gluss members in the most fully and least fully extended configurations.

This repo holds the physical designs of such a joint, which I call a "turret joint".

Today I spoke with Adonis at TechShop, the young man who makes suped-up Nerf guns that are really Hollywood quality.

He suggested:
* Laser etching a cryptech pattern onto the surface of the ball -- hexagons will look especially cool!
* Making the innner ball out of translucent filament, and adding colored LEDs, which could be tied to the motion of 
the associated actuators.
* Also try to get a smoother finish.

## A different approach to the Turret Joint.

Although the current design has the great advantage that it is is completely 3D printable, it might be possible to make a
design that uses the locking differently.

Such a design would still have the "ball" which provides compressive stength, and the rotors which would conform to the shape of 
the ball.  However, a cable sould take the place of the lock to provide tensile strength (to keep the joint from flying apart.)

In order to allow motion, the "ball" would have to have a cone-shaped cavity at each joint. The cable would begin at the center of the 
ball (or on a line on the axix of the cone intersecting the center of the ball.)

It is not obvious that this is superior in anyway. It might actually be harder to manufacture.  It is not clear that it provides
any real advantages. We would have to carefuly consider the mechanical proprerites of the joint.
